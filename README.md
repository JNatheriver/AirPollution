## Project Structure
### Backend:
* Uses Express.js and Node.js to handle API requests.
* Fetches air quality data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
* Hides the OpenWeatherMap API key using environment variables.
* Returns appropriate responses based on API status codes.
### Frontend:
* Uses React Native for cross-platform mobile development.
* Utilizes TypeScript for type safety and code maintainability.
* Implements a custom speedometer component using Skia for smooth animations.
* Fetches and displays air quality data from the backend API.
* Uses react-native-reanimated for smooth and performant animations.
* Implements a clean and user-friendly interface.
### Key Features
#### Air Quality Data Visualization: 
* The app displays air quality data in a visually appealing and informative way using a custom speedometer component.
* Real-time Data Updates: The app fetches and displays air quality data in real-time, providing users with up-to-date information.
* User Location Awareness: The app utilizes the device's location to fetch air quality data specific to the user's current location.
* Clean and Intuitive Interface: The app features a clean and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate and understand.
* Cross-platform Compatibility: The app is built with React Native, making it compatible with both iOS and Android devices.
